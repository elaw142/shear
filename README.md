# Shear

Shear is a Windows x64 VST3 distortion plugin built with JUCE. It is designed around a sharp, split-waveform visual identity and a simple control surface for cutting, folding, clipping, and crushing incoming audio.

## Features

- Four distortion modes: Warm, Hard, Fold, and Crush.
- Input, Drive, Tone, Bias, Mix, and Output controls.
- HQ mode with an interpolated shaping path for smoother high-drive edges.
- Input and output RMS meters.
- Animated transfer-curve display.
- Host state save/restore through JUCE's `AudioProcessorValueTreeState`.
- Modern dark UI with a Shear wordmark and diagonal cut logo.

## Download

Download the latest release asset named like:

```text
Shear-v1.0.0-windows-vst3.zip
```

Extract it and copy `Shear.vst3` to:

```text
C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3
```

Then open FL Studio and rescan plugins.

If you previously installed an older local prototype of this plugin, remove that old VST3 bundle before rescanning so the host does not cache duplicate plugin entries.

## Build From Source

Requirements:

- Windows x64.
- Visual Studio 2022 with the Desktop development with C++ workload.
- JUCE 8.x modules available at the path configured in `Shear.jucer` and the generated Visual Studio project files.

The current generated project expects JUCE modules at:

```text
D:\Programs\JUCE\modules
```

To build the VST3 from PowerShell:

```powershell
& 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\Msbuild\Current\Bin\amd64\MSBuild.exe' 'Builds\VisualStudio2026\Shear.sln' /t:"Shear - VST3" /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64 /m
```

The built VST3 appears at:

Builds\VisualStudio2026\x64\Release\VST3\Shear.vst3
```
